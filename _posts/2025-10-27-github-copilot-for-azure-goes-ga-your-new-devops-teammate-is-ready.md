# GitHub Copilot for Azure Goes GA: Your New DevOps Teammate Is Ready

**TL;DR:**
GitHub Copilot for Azure reached General Availability, making it ready for production environments and enterprise-scale adoption.
With GA, Agent Mode support is now available, unlocking a new era of agentic DevOps for every Azure developer.
This means you can now orchestrate multi-step infrastructure workflows directly from VS Code without context-switching to the Azure Portal.

## What Just Shipped
GitHub Copilot for Azure now supports Agent Mode, a transformative advancement that reimagines GitHub Copilot as your proactive, intelligent teammate—one that can not only suggest code, but break down complex DevOps instructions, coordinate tasks, and interact directly with Azure resources (with your approval).
This isn't just a chat interface anymore.
Agent Mode Orchestration moves beyond code suggestions, orchestrating and executing multi-step infrastructure and DevOps workflows.
Think of it as having a senior DevOps engineer sitting next to you, ready to handle the boring stuff.

## Why This Matters for .NET Developers

If you're shipping .NET apps on Azure, you're probably juggling:
- Bicep templates and ARM deployments
- App Service configurations
- Database provisioning
- CI/CD pipeline tweaks
GitHub Copilot for Azure uses your real Azure resource details as context to provide custom-tailored solutions.
That means it understands your actual infrastructure, not generic examples.

### Real-World Example

Instead of:
1. Opening VS Code
2. Switching to Azure Portal
3. Checking resource names and IDs
4. Returning to VS Code to write Bicep
5. Running `az` CLI commands
6. Debugging failures

You can now tell Copilot:

```
@azure Rename the new storage account in the bicep template by removing 
all non-alphabetic characters and create it in East US instead of West US.
```
Copilot can generate code that adheres to Azure libraries and recommended practices, create and edit infrastructure-as-code artifacts for Azure resources, deploy and troubleshoot applications on Azure, and get information about your Azure resources including settings, certificate expiration, and resource health.
## The Cost & Latency Angle
GitHub Copilot for Azure integrates with your day-to-day development workspace in Visual Studio Code.
No new tool to learn. No additional licensing complexity—it works with existing GitHub Copilot subscriptions (Pro, Pro+, Business, Enterprise).

Latency? You're already in your IDE. No context-switching tax.
It's ready for production and sensitive workloads, with built-in security and access controls.
## Integration Steps (TL;DR)

1. **Install the extension:** Download GitHub Copilot for Azure from the VS Code Marketplace
2. **Authenticate:** Sign in with your GitHub account
3. **Use the `@azure` command:** Start typing prompts that mention Azure
4. **Review before executing:**
Request "Create a step-by-step checklist plan that I can review before I authorize you to execute the plan." This forces Copilot to think ahead of its actions and explain its approach.
## A Word of Caution

This is agentic AI—it can execute infrastructure changes.
Enterprise Security and Compliance features ensure it's ready for production and sensitive workloads, with built-in security and access controls.
But always review the plan before hitting "authorize." Trust, but verify.

## The Bigger Picture
With GA, Agent Mode support is unlocking a new era of agentic DevOps for every Azure developer.
This is part of a broader shift:
agentic DevOps is the next evolution of DevOps, reimagined for a world where intelligent agents collaborate with you and with each other, automating and optimizing every stage of the software lifecycle.
For .NET teams, this means less time wrestling with infrastructure and more time building features that matter. The future of DevOps isn't about mastering CLI commands—it's about collaborating with AI that understands your platform.
