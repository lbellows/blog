# Changelog

## 2026-03-13
- Flattened the .NET generator layout to the repo root (`BlogGenerator.sln`, `BlogGenerator/`, `BlogGenerator.Core/`, `BlogGenerator.Tests/`) and updated build, test, workflow, and docs paths to match.
- Removed the obsolete Python generator code, shared Python utilities, `requirements.txt`, caches, and virtualenv artifacts now that the C# rewrite is the only supported pipeline.
- Removed code-level fallback content/model defaults so `BlogGenerator/appsettings.json` is now the single non-secret settings source, with startup validation for missing values.
- Refactored the Azure Foundry path to use the Azure OpenAI-compatible `ResponsesClient` with `FOUNDRY_OPENAI_ENDPOINT` and `FOUNDRY_PROJECT_API_KEY`, removing the `Azure.AI.Projects`/AAD runtime dependency.
- Updated the Foundry web-search path to honor `FoundryDefaultModel` as the first deployment tried, force the preview web-search tool, and bias prompts toward `AllowedDomains`.
- Hardened Foundry startup validation so empty Azure OpenAI endpoints or API keys fail with a clear error, and updated the GitHub Actions workflow/docs to use the new Foundry secret names.
- Removed `DeepSeek-V3.2` from the default Foundry deployment list because Azure documents it as lacking tool-calling support.
- Restored the C# Anthropic generator default to `claude-sonnet-4-6`, surfaced Anthropic error bodies when a request is rejected, and deduped bound domain/model lists before building provider requests.
- Updated the daily publishing workflow to `actions/checkout@v5` so it runs on Node 24 and avoids the GitHub Actions Node 20 deprecation warning.
- Updated post generation to strip the leading markdown H1 from saved posts so the page layout title is not duplicated in rendered articles.
- Updated prompts and post writing to remove model-generated inline post metadata like `**Published:** ... ~850 words` from future posts.

## 2025-11-14
- Consolidated Claude/Foundry defaults (models, token/temperature caps, meme guidance toggle) inside `scripts/common/settings.py` so only secrets and endpoints rely on environment variables.
- Cleaned up the Azure Foundry generator to drop the unused `FOUNDARY_URL` fallback, use the shared settings object, and relocate retry prompts into `scripts/common/prompts.py`.
- Updated `README.md` to describe the new configuration knobs and cleared the completed TODO list.
- Tied `write_post` defaults (author attribution, meme generation) directly to `GenerationSettings`, so the generators no longer pass those knobs around and meme rendering follows the same setting that controls prompt guidance.
- Added Claude `max_tokens`/`temperature` and `POST_AUTHOR` defaults to `GenerationSettings` plus documentation tweaks covering the new toggles.

## 2025-10-23
- Refined `generate_post_websearch.py` to enforce a 2-day breaking-news window, weekday vs. Sunday cadence, humor, and meme prompts.
- Added optional `TOPIC_URL` workflow input plus documentation updates covering the new tunables and tone guidelines.
- Added contextual meme generation with Pillow so each post includes a fresh image saved under `assets/images/memes/`.
- Use more breaking news: time box search to only include up to last 2 days (`RECENT_WINDOW_DAYS`).
- Mix up content cadence: focused weekday posts, Sunday synopsis mode.
- Relax technology coverage: require at least one of .NET/Azure/GitHub per post.
- Add a light humorous tone.
- Prompt for meme-friendly images in the generated markdown.
- Allow workflow input to drive a specific topic or link (`TOPIC_URL`).
- Refactored generators to consume shared prompt, cadence, and meme utilities in `scripts/common/` for both Anthropic and Azure workflows.
- Automatically load local `.env` files when running generators to simplify secret management.
- Strip leading LLM instruction blocks before writing posts so published articles start at the H1 title.
- Expanded default `ALLOWED_DOMAINS` to include Microsoft ecosystem sources and high-signal tech press for fresher breaking news (replacing blocked domains like `theverge.com` and `zdnet.com` with crawler-friendly alternatives).
- Simplified GitHub Actions workflow to lean entirely on code defaults instead of duplicating tunable env vars.
- Locked generator tunables to code-level constants so only secrets come from environment variables.
- Tags are now inferred from post headings/TL;DR and include the source model name (defaulting to Claude); existing posts were retagged accordingly.
